## Intro
I put together this repo to share some of the docs that I have made for my own reference when creating bots, as well as some of what I have used with ChatGPT to make my vision a reality.  A ChatGPT Pro subscription really helps with the JavaScript and JSON side of things, if you're either not knowledgable about that stuff or are dealing with **massive** amounts of info, as it includes access to Codex, which is designed to link to GitHub and help with coding specifically.

## What you should know
I'm putting a few different reference files on here.
